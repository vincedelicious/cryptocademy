  <p><strong>Welcome to Cryptocademy!</strong></p>
  <p>Our lessons take the form of cards with <strong>keywords</strong>, <strong>definitions</strong> &amp; <strong>examples</strong>, followed by a quiz.</p>
  <p>The idea of each lesson is to introduce you to the main concept &amp; then dive into the topic!</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ll go into more detail for each concept; so don&rsquo;t worry too much about memorising every word üöÄ</p>

  <p>Now imagine if that ledger was on the internet and being looked at by billions of people &amp; computers.</p>
  <p>Everyone looking at this ledger has a copy of it, and every time there is a new transaction everyone checks to that everyone else got that same transaction and no one is writing down fake stuff.</p>

  <p>Think... an encyclopaedia or a novel. You can&#39;t add pages or text to it, it&#39;s just put up there by someone else for you to read.</p>

  <p>The thing is, how do you &#39;own&#39; something that is digital and you can just copy, paste and duplicate?</p>
  <p>This is the next step: <strong>verifiable digital ownership</strong></p>
  <p>Web3 is what we think this embodies, existing on blockchains & distributed + decentralised.</p>
  <p>These &lsquo;versions&rsquo; don&rsquo;t have updates to run or destroy old versions of sites, it&rsquo;s just a kind of lens to view the internet and what sort of things its users are getting up to.</p>

  <p>Coins in your pocket are things you can exchange for snacks and coffee, but you can&rsquo;t eat them!</p>
  <p>Now that you know about the ability to own digital stuff, think of Tokens as <strong>coins that live on the blockchain</strong> and <strong>can be exchanged</strong> for stuff.</p>
  <p>The value of a Token is determined by many things, but it&rsquo;s important to note that <em>not all Tokens are the same</em>, and <em>anyone</em> can make a Token!</p>
  <p>Common Tokens you may have heard of could be <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Ether</strong> or <strong>DogeCoin</strong>.</p>

  <p>A Wallet on Web3 is a thing that <strong>stores information about what you own on the blockchain.</strong></p>
  <p>It is made up of two things: An &lsquo;<strong>address</strong>&rsquo; and a &lsquo;<strong>private key</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>The <strong>address is public information</strong>, but your <strong>private key must never be shared with anyone!</strong></p>
  <h2><strong>Anyone who has your private key can access the stuff in your wallet!</strong></h2>
  <p>Exactly like if their hand could reach right into your physical wallet and take your stuff!</p>
