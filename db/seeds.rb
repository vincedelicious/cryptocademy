  "Imagine a ledger or logbook that keeps a record of transactions. Now imagine if that ledger was on the internet and being looked at by billions of people & computers.
  Everyone looking at this ledger has a copy of it, and every time there is a new transaction, everyone checks to make sure that everyone else got that same transaction and no one is writing down some funny business.
  That is essentially a blockchain! It‚Äôs a shared & distributed record (chain) of transactions  (blocks) that are being monitored & agreed upon by so many computers that it is essentially impossible to hack or defraud.
  Blockchain is the technology that makes Web3 possible!",

  Web2 was when users could upload info like videos, blogs & posts to sites - this is where most of the internet today is!
  Web3 is what we think is the next version of the internet that exists on blockchains and is more decentralised & involves tokens.
  These ‚Äòversions‚Äô don‚Äôt have updates to run or destroy old versions of sites, it‚Äôs just a kind of lens to view the internet and what sort of things its users are getting up to.

  We will definitely go more into detail, but for now think of Tokens as coins that live on the blockchain and can be exchanged for stuff.
  The value of a Token is determined by many things, but it‚Äôs important to note that not all Tokens are the same, and anyone can make a Token!
  Common Tokens you may have heard of could be Bitcoin, Ether or Doge Coin

  "A Wallet in the Web3 sense is a thing that stores information about what you own on the blockchain.
  It is made up of two things: An ‚Äòaddress‚Äô and a ‚Äòprivate key‚Äô
  More details in a later lesson, but just know for now that the address is public information, but your private key must never be shared with anyone!
  Anyone who has the private key can access all the contents of your wallet and do whatever they like with it, like if their hand could reach right into your physical wallet and take whatever they like!
