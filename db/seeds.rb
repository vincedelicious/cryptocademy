# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# lesson = Lesson.create(title: "Lesson 1", points: 10, description: "This is lesson 1")
# lesson = Lesson.create(title: "Lesson 2", points: 20, description: "This is lesson 2")
# lesson = Lesson.create(title: "Lesson 3", points: 30, description: "This is lesson 3")
# lesson = Lesson.create(title: "Lesson 4", points: 40, description: "This is lesson 4")
# lesson = Lesson.create(title: "Lesson 5", points: 50, description: "This is lesson 5")
